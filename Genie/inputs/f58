BODY;CHARSET=UTF-8;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:I love you because you find a way to make me smile every single day, regardless of how I'm feeling. You care about me and how I'm feeling, and you go out of your way to try and make things better if they're not. You're handsome, brilliant, and incredibly funny. You're honest, giving, and gentle. You make me feel beautiful and wanted. You make everything exponentially better :)
