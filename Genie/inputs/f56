BODY;CHARSET=UTF-8;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:If you could live the next twenty four hours then erase it and start over (with only you remembering what happened), what would you do?=0D=0AMarry the girl I love and enjoy the first night together.  We're not at the point yet in our relationship or lives where marriage is the right thing, but just one day to celebrate us and a whole night of fun... the memory of that would be enough to tide me over until the real thing happened. It's a shame she wouldn't be able to remember it as well...
