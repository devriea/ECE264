BODY;CHARSET=UTF-8;ENCODING=QUOTED-PRINTABLE:So, continuing with my analogy, there's a reason you are my Dodge Charger, and not something else.=0D=0AMost people my age want Mustangs, Challengers, Camaros, etc. These cars all have something in common: they look great, but are not very functional. Eventually, these guys are gonna have to grow up, sell the car, and get a realistic car.=0D=0AThat's where the Charger comes in. Take a look at it some time; it looks just as good as any of the three previously mentioned, except it's a four door instead of a coupe.  Not only is it sexy as hell, it's a car that you don't have to grow up and sell one day, it's a car that seats five comfortably, so you can have a family and still drive it. I can see a future with it.=0D=0ASo that's why you're a Dodge Charger. :)
